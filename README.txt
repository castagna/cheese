  Cheese vocabulary/ontology (and instance data)
  ==============================================

  This is an initial version of a cheese vocabulary|ontology and instance
  data on Italian cheeses.

  At first, only DOP Italian cheeses will be included, then other Italian
  cheeses. Then French cheeses, English cheeses, German, Dutch, etc.

  Look at cheese.ttl (i.e. RDF serialised as Turtle) for the vocabulary|
  ontology, all the rest is instance data.

  Any help/feedback/error corrections is appreciated.
